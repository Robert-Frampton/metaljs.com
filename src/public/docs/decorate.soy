		<h1>Decorate</h1>

		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">Progressive enhancement</a> is a feature that is very important for a lot of people. Knowing about this, Metal.js is prepared to deal with content that already comes rendered from the server. In that case, instead of calling <code>render</code> the developer can call <code>decorate</code> instead. This will skip the rendering phase of the component, running only the code that enhances it with JavaScript behavior instead.</p>

		<p>For SoyComponent, this means that the template won't be rendered, but the <code>attached</code> lifecycle method will still be called.</p>

		<p>It's important to note that building components with SoyComponent also helps with progressive enhancement in another way: by providing a faithful template that can be run by the server without having to duplicate the rendering code or run JavaScript at all.</p>

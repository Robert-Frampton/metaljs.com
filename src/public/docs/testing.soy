		<h1>Testing your component</h1>

		<p>Besides source code files, the <a href="https://github.com/metal/generator-metal">Yeoman generator</a> we used on the section about <a href="/docs">creating your own component</a> also generates some files to help you write tests. It assumes you'll be using <a href="http://mochajs.org">Mocha</a> and <a href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a> for describing tests, and <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html">Karma</a> as the test runner. Since Karma is being used, you'll see that a <strong>karma.conf.js</strong> file was generated in your project directory, already set up for your tests. You just need to implement your test cases on the <code>test/&lt;componentName&gt;.js</code> generated file and use the tasks that <strong>gulp-metal</strong> provides for running them.</p>

		<h2>gulp test</h2>

		<p>This will run all your tests once according to the configuration that is defined by the <strong>karma.config.js</strong> file. If the project was created via the generator, this file will already have been configured for you, and so this command will run all test files present in the <strong>test</strong> directory on the Chrome browser.</p>

		<h2>gulp test:coverage</h2>

		<p>The same as <code>gulp test</code>, but after running the tests it will also open a coverage report on your browser.</p>

		<h2>gulp test:watch</h2>

		<p>The same as <code>gulp test</code>, but instead of running the tests only once it watches for changes on source or test files and runs the tests again automatically when that happens.</p>

		<h2>gulp test:browsers</h2>

		<p>The same as <code>gulp test</code>, but overrides the <strong>browsers</strong> configuration of <strong>karma.config.js</strong> to run on all these instead: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE9 - Win7, IE10 - Win7, IE11 - Win7. Note that you have to install the appropriate karma browser launchers for this task to work properly.</p>

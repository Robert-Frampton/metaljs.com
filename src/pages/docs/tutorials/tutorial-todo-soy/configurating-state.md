## {$page.title}

As previously mentioned, Metal components automatically respond to the data
passed to them and rerender. For a component to take advantage of this behavior, 
however, it needs to be told what data to respond to. This is where state comes 
in.

JSX components have two state managers, one for internal state (STATE), and one
for external properties that are passed down to it (PROPS).

Soy components on the other hand only have one state manager that is used for
both internal and external properties (STATE).

### Storing The Todos

Let's configure the `TodoApp` component to store an array of todos with a
default value:

```text/javascript
// TodoApp.js

class TodoApp extends Component {
	...
}

TodoApp.STATE = {
	todos: {
		// Default value
		value: [
			{
				done: false,
				title: 'Todo 1'
			},
			{
				done: false,
				title: 'Todo 2'
			}
		]
	}
};
```

Now that there is a default value set, you can access the value in the Soy
template after defining it as a soy `param`:

```soy
&#123;namespace TodoApp&#125;

/**
 * This renders the component's whole content.
 */
&#123;template .render&#125;
	{@param? todos: ?}

	<div>Todo: {$todos[0].title}</div>
&#123;/template&#125;
```

Which results in the following markup:

```text/xml
<div>Todo: Todo 1</div>
```

Obviously, this markup isn't very useful. We'll get to rendering the entire list
in a minute.

### Item

The `TodoItem` component will need two properties defined in STATE: one for
keeping track of it's index inside the list and one for containing the todo
data itself:

```text/javascript
// TodoItem.js

class TodoItem extends Component {
	...
}

TodoItem.STATE = {
	index: {
		value: null
	},

	todo: {
		value: null
	}
};
```

These STATE properties will act as read-only for the `TodoItem` component, as
the values will always be defined by the parent component and passed down.

### Form

The `TodoForm` only needs one property that will eventually be used to keep
track of the value of it's input:

```text/javascript
// TodoForm.js

class TodoForm extends Component {
	...
}

TodoForm.STATE = {
	value: {
		value: ''
	}
};
```

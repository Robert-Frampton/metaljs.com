Before we actually make anything, let's discuss what Metal.js is and what it's
intended for.

**Note:** if you're interested in using Metal.js with Soy templates, check out
the [Soy tutorial](/docs/tutorials/tutorial-todo-soy/before-we-start.html) instead.

### Data flow

If you're familiar with React, you'll feel right at home. Metal.js is a
foundation for creating UI components that automatically respond to data when
it's updated. In other words, it's a framework for creating one-way data binding
components.

This is different from frameworks like Angular, which provide a two-way data
binding solution.

### Templating

Metal.js is template agnostic and comes with out-of-the-box support for two
templating languages: Soy (Google Closure) and JSX (React).

When the data being passed to your component changes, your component's template
rerenders just the parts of your component that need to be updated. Therefore, 
you don't need to worry about manual DOM manipulation.

Behind the scenes Metal.js is using Google's [Incremental DOM](https://google.github.io/incremental-dom) 
for updating DOM elements.

### What are we making?

In this tutorial, we'll be making a simple Todo App that let's you mark items as
completed and add new items to the list. If you would like to see the finished
product check out the [metal-tutorial-todo](https://github.com/metal/metal-tutorial-todo) repository.
